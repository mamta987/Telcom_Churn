# Telecom Churn Prediction

## Introduction

Telecom industry being a very competitive field faces high rates of customer churn than retention. With the rapid development of telecommunication service providers it has become very crucial to identify the customers who are likely to terminate their service after a certain period of time with the company. It has become very crucial to find the factors that increase customer churn and take necessary actions in reducing it. 

In this project will find the driving factors of churn and build a ML Classification model to predict the customers who are most likely to churn. 

## Problem Statement 

We have the past information of a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. The main parameters of this data include :

 - Demographics (age, gender etc.)
 - Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)
 - Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)
 

Based on all this information, we will build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned.
